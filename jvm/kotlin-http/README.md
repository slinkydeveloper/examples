# Kotlin HTTP example

Example with Kotlin coroutines interface and HTTP server.

## Setup credentials

Because the SDK is not public yet, you need to set up the PAT credentials, see https://github.com/restatedev/e2e#setup-local-env

## Running the example

You can run the Kotlin greeter service via:

```shell
./gradlew run
```

Or from the Intellij IDEA UI.

## Build a docker image

```shell
./gradlew jibDockerBuild
```
